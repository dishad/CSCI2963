My group (table 10) changed 2 aspects of the FreeBSD webpages, both of which were broken links. To fix these, all we did was change the links so that they now pointed to the correct place. I learned that maintaining good documentation is critical to the end-user because it is needed for them to get the full experience of whatever you are providing.
