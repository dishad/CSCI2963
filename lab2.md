##Why is it important to choose a license?
It is important to choose a license based on your needs/worries. For instance if you want to just get to it and share it with the world, use an MIT License and you are not liable for anything. If you are concerned about software patents an Apache License is your man because it provides an express grant of patent rights from contributions to users. If you care about the software improving as a whole then the GPL (copyleft license) would have anyone who distributes your code or a derivative work to make the source available under the same terms. Even if the licenses I stated aren't for you, there are still plenty of licenses left for you to pick through and select for your specific project.

##Why shouldn't you use a project that doesn't have a license?
A license is to grant permission to someone to use something or to allow an activity to take place. So when you see a project that doesn't have a license, that specifically means that you do NOT have permission to use that software how you see fit.

##Failure to follow section
I agree with the claim as open communications and open source software go hand in hand. By releasing your software to the public early so that you can gain adherents and then let a larger development community make improvements, which is what a project needs in order to be relevant and catered for developers.

##Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT License(Why is such a license chosen?)
The reason the .NET Core uses an MIT License is due to it being a part of the .NET Foundation which strives for community involvement in all their projects, and the MIT License allows for express use for anybody to use and modify their software.

##Example project and license
My example project would be software the watches all the files in your repository since you started your application and restarts the service whenever changes are made to those files to allow for quick development, much like nodemon. I think that I would go the same route as nodemon and use an MIT License for my project since community feedback and involvment is essential for the software to be useful for developers.

##GPL, LGPL, BSD
The general idea for all these licenses is similar, free software is great. GPL allows anyone to run the software, to have the source code, to redistribute the software, and to distribute your modifications to the software. These are known as the 4 freedoms which sound great to any company or developer interested in open source. The BSD license is a little different since it gives "you" the right to distribute the software but not necessarily thr next guy. So if you get software from the same source, change it, and give it to someone, you can forbid them from passing it on. Reflecting on these two licenses, it seems the 4 freedoms really had the developer in mind so I would say GPL = developers and since the BSD License has the right to prohibit people from passing on your modified software I see it as more of a company license, BSD = companies.

##Project
A project that really interests me that I can work on for this course is ESLint. This project interests me as it is an up and coming big development tool for web services which I used during my internship last Summer. ESLint is a javascript linter aimed at developers working on a team that stresses a user-defined style so that code is more readable and reliable. The current license for ESLint is the MIT License, allowing for anyone to jump into the project and help, whether it be by fixing bugs or adding rules that ESLint can check for.
